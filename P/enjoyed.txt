I enjoyed my learning journey with DECI and Udacity, particularly the connect and physical sessions, and the opportunity to explore new topics. I found the following topics most interesting: software and binary/ASCII code, hardware components, multimedia and image representation, HTML/CSS, digital audio formats, networks and DHCP, domain names, ISPs, IP addresses, LANs, MAC addresses, WANs, network servers, data encryption and hashing. I also learned how to secure my home network using MAC addresses and about data transmission over the internet. Encryption and hashing were also fascinating topics, and I learned about converting plain text into ciphertext and the process of hashing input data.
