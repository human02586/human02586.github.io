I want to expand my knowledge of Python programming, web development (including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), security tools, and artificial intelligence. I plan to explore advanced Python topics, learn server-side programming languages like PHP and Java, and gain knowledge of machine learning algorithms, deep learning frameworks, and natural language processing techniques.
