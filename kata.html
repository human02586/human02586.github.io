    <p>
    <b>Heian Shodan</b> is the first kata in the Heian series and is usually the first kata that a beginner 
    must learn. It has <b>21 movements</b> and its embusen is roughly <b>I-shaped</b>.  
    </p> 
    &nbsp;
    <p>This kata takes the student through a similar floor 
      pattern as Taikyoku Shodan, but incorporates different techniques including a hammer fist and a knife hand block.
      The kata also introduces changing stances from the normal front stance into a cat stance, and later into a back stance.
